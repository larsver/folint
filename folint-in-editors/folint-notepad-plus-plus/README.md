# FOlint support in Notepad++

This is a brief guide detailing how to use the FOLint tool in Notepad++.
FOlint is a linting tool for FO(Â·), a language used by the IDP system.

Firstly, you need to install FOLint. 

Secondly, we need to install the necesarry Notepad++ plugins. 
The plugins we need are NppEventExec(https://github.com/MIvanchev/NppEventExec) and NppExec(https://github.com/d0vgan/nppexec). 
Probaly they are already installed. If not go in Notepad++ to Plugins and install NppEventExec and NppExec.

If everything is installed go to plugins. Choose NppExec plugin and choose execute.
Here you need to make a command and give it a name like "folint". DOn't forget to save it.

```
NPP_SAVE
 cd "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
 env_set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
 python -u -m pylint "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
```

Now you can run this by open a .idp file, go back to NppExec execute... .
Choose folint and click run. This will add a Console window at the bottom of Notepad++'s window. 
In this window you will see the output of FOLint package.

Then you go to the NppEventExec plugin to make an event on wich this command needs to be executed.
You choose 'Add rules', where you add a new rule. 
You give this rule a name. Then choose event NPPP_FILESAVED, to execute it when you save your file. 
Next you fill ".*[^.]\.(idp) " in by regex, this to only used this event on .idp files. 
At last you give the name of command you made in the NppExec plugin, 'folint', and tick the checkbox of 'enabled'.

Now everytime you save your .idp, folint will be executed and show the output in the console window.
To make the output warnings/errors clickable to go to the line were the warning/error is located in the code.

You go again to the NppExec plugin and choose "Console Output Filters..". Choose tab HighLight.
Tick the first two checkboxes and fill in the corresponding texbox follow rules in: 
first one = "Warning: line %LINE% - colStart %CHAR%Fill" and 
the second one = "Error: line %LINE% - colStart %CHAR%".
Then you can choose the colors of errors/warnings.

If everything is done the output line are clickable and show the corresponding line in the code were the warning/error is located.
